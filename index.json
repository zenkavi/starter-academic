To this end I investigate the psychometric properties of measures in the field and build statistical models for neuroimaging data that account for the brain’s network structure.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://zenkavi.github.io/author/a.-zeynep-enkavi/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/a.-zeynep-enkavi/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a postdoctoral scholar at Caltech working with .

It consists of a Python application and a repository of behavioral experiments and surveys coded in javascript using jsPsych (de Leeuw, 2015). As we hoped for it has been used by other researchers for their experiments as well.\nReproducible meta-analysis\nThis is a prospective project in a very early stage that I want to continue working on in the near future. The broad aim is to build tools that would enable researchers to conduct fast and reproducible meta-analyses. Some components I am currently considering include:\nStandardized data format for meta-analysis search results Browser widget that saves dated search queries and results Online platform to upload published/unpublished datasets Result and keyword extractor from published papers Crowd-sourced tagging system of extracted results References:\nKliemann, D., Adolphs, R., Armstrong, T., Galdi, P., Kahn, D.A., Rusch, T., Enkavi, A.Z., Liang, D., Lograsso, S., Zhu, W. and Yu, R., (2022).

It does lack, however, a clear understanding of how these constructs and the measures relate to each other. As part of the Science of Behavior Change initiative we addressed this question by running a large battery (35 tasks, 23 surveys) on a large sample (n=552).\nTrait measures of self-regulation\nTasked with finding the best ‘behavioral assays’ of self-regulation we examined the stability of all the measures from our large battery of tasks and surveys. We followed up with 150 of our participants who completed our battery and asked them to complete it a second time 2-4 months after their initial completion. Additionally we completed a detailed analysis of the literature on the retest reliability of all our measures for comparability with our dataset. We found that the literature was noisy to begin with and that the survey measures were more reliable than task measures.\nReferences:\nMazza, G. L., Smyth, H. L., Bissett, P. G, Canning, J.
