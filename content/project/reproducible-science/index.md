title: Reproducible science
summary: Experiment Factory is an “an open source framework for the development and deployment of web-based experiments.” We developed this platform to run our large scale multiwave online experiments. It consists of a Python application and a repository of behavioral experiments and surveys coded in javascript using jsPsych (de Leeuw, 2015). As we hoped for it has been used by other researchers for their experiments as well.

**Experiment Factory**
Experiment Factory is an “an open source framework for the development and deployment of web-based experiments.” We developed this platform to run our large scale multiwave online experiments. It consists of a Python application and a repository of behavioral experiments and surveys coded in javascript using jsPsych (de Leeuw, 2015). As we hoped for it has been used by other researchers for their experiments as well.

**Reproducible meta-analysis**
This is a prospective project in a very early stage that I want to continue working on in the near future. The broad aim is to build tools that would enable researchers to conduct fast and reproducible meta-analyses. Some components I am currently considering include:

- Standardized data format for meta-analysis search results
- Browser widget that saves dated search queries and results
- Online platform to upload published/unpublished datasets
- Result and keyword extractor from published papers
- Crowd-sourced tagging system of extracted results
- Search engine to filter extracted results
