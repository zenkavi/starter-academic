I am a postdoctoral scholar at Caltech working with [Antonio Rangel](http://www.hss.caltech.edu/people/antonio-rangel). I received my PhD from Stanford where I worked with [Russell Poldrack](https://profiles.stanford.edu/russell-poldrack). I study the neural correlates of decision-making, particularly decisions that involve self-control. My work has a strong emphasis on methodological rigor and reproducibility. To this end I investigate the psychometric properties of measures in the field and build statistical models for neuroimaging data that account for the brain's network structure.
