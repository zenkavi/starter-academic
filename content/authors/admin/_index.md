I am an Assistant Professor of Integrated Science at the [Kravis Department of Integrated Sciences](https://www.cmc.edu/kravis-department-of-integrated-sciences/faculty-and-staff) at Claremont McKenna College. I received my PhD from Stanford where I worked with [Russell Poldrack](https://profiles.stanford.edu/russell-poldrack) and completed post-doctoral work at Caltech working with [Antonio Rangel](http://www.hss.caltech.edu/people/antonio-rangel). I study the neurobiological correlates of decisions that involve self-control using primarily functional neuroimaging and computational models. I am also interested in meta-science aspects of human neuroimaging including tools for automated meta-analysis and factors that increase replicability of findings.
