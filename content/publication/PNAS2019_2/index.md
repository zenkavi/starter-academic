abstract: "In their Letter to the Editor, Friedman and Banich (1) suggest we (2) “overstate” the higher suitability of dependent variables (DVs) derived from surveys for individual difference analyses. We appreciate this opportunity for a continued discussion regarding the measurement of self-regulation. However, their critiques (1) do not provide evidence against the higher reliability of survey DVs, which is central to our conclusions. Instead, they levy criticisms addressed in another of our papers (3)."
